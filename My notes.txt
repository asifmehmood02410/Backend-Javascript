How to setup a Backend Project Professionally.

-   Create Folder and set professional name of your folder
-   Go into terminal of VS code and set command "npm init"


-   git cannt push empty folders in github untill unless any one file will exist in folder

+++++  Public/temp folders  ++++++
-   Store your pictures in Publich Folder > temp. This file will be mostly empty beacuse picture will save in AWS cloud. But we save our picture in my local project temporarly in Public>temp folder. For the sake of git we will create a .gitkeep file in temp folder to puch all folders and files in git hub repristry. 


+++++  .gitignore file ++++++
-   .gitignore file used to prevent to move sensitive data into github repository. We will mentioned the files / folder names in .gitignor these files and folders will not push on github. 
-   For .gitignore we use "Git Ignore Genereators" from google and add node in search bar it will create git ignore general files which mostly used. i am using this link "https://mrkandreev.name/snippets/gitignore-generator/"


+++++  .env file  ++++++
-   it is also production file. It will not move into github

+++++  src folder  ++++++
-   This folder will hold my all components my all logic files.
-   create folders in src controllers, db, middlewares, routes, utils


+++++  nodemon packege  ++++++
-   When ever we change in the files and folder we must need to restart our server to get new changes.
-   nodemon package used to help us to auto restart our server on save changes. No need to restart server.
-   we install this package in dev-Dependency. This mean it will only use in Dev enviornment not in production enviornment.
-   command use " npm install -D nodemon". 
-   -D use to install this package as dev Dependency.
-   add this code in "package.json" file.
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "nodemon src/index.js"
    }

+++++  package.json  ++++++
-   add "type" : "module" in this file before "script". It is used to "import" the required package if i set commonJs instead of module then "required" key word use to import the package.

+++++  prettier package  ++++++
-   install prettier package in dev Dependency for the code formate consistancy. When multiple users will work on this project we will set the formate layout using prettier package.
-   command " npm install -D prettier"
-   After installation add these two files in your project.  
-   ".prettierrc" (it save prettier configuration. you can also read the documentation of this) 
-   ".prettierignore" (it save these files name which we mentioned that where prettier formatting will not work, you can also get general files from Google by prettier ignore generator)
